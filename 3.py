"""P3: A* Search is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path between a start node and a target node in a graph. It combines features of both Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (which guarantees the shortest path) and Greedy Best-First Search (which uses heuristics to prioritize nodes closer to the goal). A* works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to explore, sorted by the sum of the cost from the start node and a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal.
